      I see code as a means to an end, so the end goal means a lot to me.
      I have an insatiable appetite for knowledge and the deepest appreciation
      for wisdom. I want to learn what I can apply.
      I like to communicate with clients and team members to understand their
      needs wholeheartedly, and deliver just the right results.

      My education in development began as six informal years of hacking around
      in Linux with a focus on security and systems programming.
      I then pursued a Computer Science degree for two years before learning
      skills hands-on for two-and-half years in the field of DevOps at a
      Providence non-profit.

        I'm now striving to take full advantage of
        <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">
          General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program</a>,
          learning new web app technologies and skills while developing my
          previous abilities much more in-depth.
