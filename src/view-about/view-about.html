      I see code as a means to an end, so the end goal means a lot to me. I have an
      insatiable appetite for knowledge and the deepest appreciation for wisdom.
      I want to learn what I can apply. I like to communicate with clients and team
      members to understand their needs wholeheartedly, and deliver just the right results.

      My education in development began as six informal years of hacking around in
      Linux with a focus on security and systems programming. I then pursued a
      Computer Science degree for two years before gaining employment for
      two-and-half years in DevOps at a Providence non-profit.

      I'm now striving to take full advantage of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program,
      learning new web app technologies and skills while developing my previous abilities much more in-depth.
